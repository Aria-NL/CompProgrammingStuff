# CompProgrammingStuff
My programs for 2020-2021 Computer Programming at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

# Compilation
Simply use g++ to compile the .cpp.

# Programs
## Rectangle
This program takes a length and width of a rectangle, then outputs its perimeter, area, and diagonal length.

## Collatz
This program takes a starting value then prints the Collatz Sequence from that value until 1 has appeared three times.

## Polish
This program takes an operator and two numbers in Polish notation (operator then number then number) and outputs the answer in standard notation.

## Partial Sum
This program takes a user n value, then a user x value. It then prints the partial sum up to x, and the entire sequence of partial sums up to n.

## Quadratic
This program takes a value from the user for a, b, and c, then uses those values to calculate solutions via the quadratic formula.

### Quadratic-Errors
Different version of Quadratic, with error-checking code.

## Matrix-Vector
This program takes 3 vector coefficients and multiplies them as a matrix with a predefined ascending 3x3 matrix.

## Smallest Missing
This program accepts a size of a vector, vector values, then sorts that vector and finds the smallest missing value.
